                How To Kill Your Family follows Grace who is on a mission to get rid of the family who wronged her and take their fortune. However, she is currently serving time for a murder that she did not commit.

In all honesty, I picked this book up because of the title, I thought it was wonderfully brilliant. I will never forget the look on my mum’s face when I asked her to grab my reservation from the library. The book wasn’t quite what I had expected, I had expected a bored housewife, but that is my own fault for not reading the blurb first! I absolutely adored the witty humour and sarcasm. Often I found myself chuckling at a throw away comment from Grace that absolutely hit the nail on the head about real life.

My biggest issue with the book was the long chapters! Some of the chapters lengths were fine, which would lull me into a false sense of security! I can understand why the chapters were laid out as they were, but I really wish the longer ones had been broken up. A few times I had to put the book down halfway through a chapter which I really don’t like to do! That being said, I loved the characters and how different they all were. Although most of them were absolutely terrible people, they felt so vivid and I did want to know what happened to them. I can honestly say I’ve never read a book quite like this before.

I recommend this book to fans of thrillers with a touch of humour.</p></aside>
